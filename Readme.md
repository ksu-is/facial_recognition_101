# Facial Recognition 101

This repository is meant to bring together information from different sources and present the topic of Facial Recognition.

The goal of this repository is take the reader through a jupyter notebook which will describe the technics, tools and working code examples.  By the end of the jupyter notebook the reader should be able to understand the concepts involved with facial recognition, and train new images and perform facial recognition on thier own input.

See the jupyter notebook for the actual presentation of this material

My goal is to have this code setup so that others may use it with simple setup for themselves if possible. The only setup required would be the actual picture taking portion to get your camera to identify your face for unlocking your machine. This would work like your iphone facial recognition. This code will make it to where only your face will be able to unlock your machine as a type of security measure.

## Setup

At a minimum you will need: (the requirements is provided but is used in other ML projects and might contain more than is actually necessary)

* OpenCV 4.1.x

* dlib

* scikit-image

* face_recognition

* imutils
